  <h2>HTML</h2><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
  <p>Hypertext markup is what allows parts of a document to become links to other pages stored locally, on a server, or can even link to another part of the same document. Attributes are name-value pairs of tags which carry special meaning depending on the tag. Amongst the various types, they are some attributes which are common across all tags for the sake of identifying tags for some other means, such as running specific scripts with the tag and thus, its content.</p><img src="coding.jpg" width="100%"> <p>These attributes are id which provides a document-wide unique identifier for the element and is commonly used with stylesheets, class which functions similarly to id with the addition that any subordinate HTML element will semantically adopt its presentation attributes as well, title which is used to provide a light explanation of an element as browsers typically display this as a tooltip when users mouse-over an element, and lang which identifies the natural language of the element's content.</p>
